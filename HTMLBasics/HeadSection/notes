This is the notes for HeadSection

We use the head section to give the browser
and search engines information about our web page

*Heads up*
in VScode if we type ! then hit Tab
we generate a html boilerplate

in the head section we have a couple 
of meta elements for giving information about this web page 
the first meta element is for defining the character set
"UTF-8"

Computers do not understand characters like A B C 
they only understand numbers which is represented in the 
binary format 0s and 1s

By using character sets we map a character to a 
numerical value

ASCII was the first character set made 
ASCII only represents the characters in the english language 

the one that we use the most often is UTF-8
This can represent almost all characters in the world

under the meta element dealing with the charSet

we have another character set that configures the viewport
the viewport is the visible area of the web page
with the element we are defining the intial width and zoom factor of the viewport 
we need this element so that our page looks good on all devices 

so as good practice every page needs to have these 2 meta elements 

there are additional meta elements 

for example:

we have a meta element to define keywords on a page 
we can type multiple words here
In the pass these keywords where used heavy for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
But these days search engines do not put so much weight on these keywords
but we can still use them as keywords to represent this page 

Another meta element for the description of the page 
using this element we can type a description that will appear on 
google or other search engines when someone searchs for the website

Take Away:
this is the purpose of meta elements with these elements
we can give information about a webpage
