This is the notes for Lists

In html we have 3 types of list elements:
ul: unordered list 
ol: ordered list
dl: description list

the type we use the most is ul
this is used to showcase a list of items where the order does not matter

a common application for this element is for implementing 
a navigation menu quite often these navigation menus are implemented using unordered list
so we are going to make a navigation menu using a ul
inside of the ul we are going to use a li which is a list item 

by default li are displayed by using bullet points
but the bullet points are a mater of styling we can 
change this with css
we can css so lay them horizontally but we will look at that later

now we can nest list to create a hierarchy
so in the courses item we are going to add a ul list 

Ordered list:
In contrast to a ul we have ol where the order of the items 
do matter 
an real world example of this would be a recipe site 

description list:
we use a dl for implementing a glossary or displaying meta data
we can have a term and details about that term

now we might wonder how often do we implement a glossary
well here is another real world application
lets say we wanted to display meta data about the course
