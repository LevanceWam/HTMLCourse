this is the notes for Psuedo-classSelectors

there is another group of selectors called 
Psuedo-classSelectors

so lets say we want to make the first paragraph
font bigger than italic

one way to do this is to give the paragraph a class 
now remember this is going to apply to any element that has this class 

now what if we only wanted this to be applied to our articles 
then we code just add the article selector next to the class
to give it a context

but this makes adding the class to the paragraph element Unnecessary
so we didnt have to give this element a class 

in css we have a bunch of Psuedo classes that are applied by the browser
Psuedo classes are not real classes that we define. they
are classes that are applied by the browser by default 

##first-child selector:
so after the article selector we are going to use a Psuedo class first-child
this will give use the same result as using a class 

the first-child selector is useful but a little fragile 

so if we add another element at the top of the hierarchy 
it will be the first child and will get the styling 

##first-of-type selector:
this is another selector
this selector will apply styles to the first occurance of elements that are different types

so out of the 2 paragraphs we have the first one will get the styling 
now we can specify the type of element that can be targeted by adding it to the front of
the selector

we have 2 more similar ones last child and last of type 

##last-of-type & last-child selector:
both of these will apply styles to the last element 

both of these are fragile because if we are using a rule like this 
article p:last-of-type or last-child {
    font-size: 140%;
    font-style: italic;
}

if we have an element that is not the target element last the styles will not 
be applied this is because the browser is looking for the targeted element to be last 

##nth-child selector:
now sometime we are going to want to style elements based on their position
in a container 
like in a table or a list and e want to highlight all the 
odd items 

so we are going to make a list and do this 

this selector is like a function in between the () we can pass a value or a argument
we can pass:
odd 
evem
3n (depending on the number that goes before n it will select every third item)


##<a> psuedo selectors:
we have a selector for visited links
