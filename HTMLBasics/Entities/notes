This is the notes for Entities

Some characters in html are reserved and 
we have to use a special notation to use them

for example we wanted to wrap the text html with angle brackets
if we tried to do this normally we VScode thinks we are trying 
to use a element 

to get around this we use HTML Entities
all of these Entities start with & and end with ;
inbetween these 2 we type some characters that determine the type 
of the html entity

entites:
<: &lt;
>: &gt;
copywrite symbol: &copy;

now we don't need to know all of the entites because we are not
going to be using all of them but here is a website to look them over 

https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref

so we are going to look at another entity but we need some dumby text
so make this inside a paragraph element type
loremNumberofWords -> lorem50 then  tab

now imagine somwhere in the text 2 words need to be stuck together 
we can get rid of the line break by using
nonbreaking space: &nbsp;
