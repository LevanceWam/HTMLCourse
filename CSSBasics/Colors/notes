This is the notes for Colors

In css we have a few different way
to represent colors:
- Named colors
- RGB (red, green, blue)
- RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha-channel)
- HSL (hue, saturation, lightness)
- HSLA (hue, saturation, lightness, alpha-channel)
- Hexadecimal (0-9, a-f)

we are going to see this in action using a div
