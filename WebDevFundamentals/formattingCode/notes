This is the notes for formatting code

An important thing to know about browsers is that they ignore the 
whitespaces in our code so everything can be a single
line and it will still work

But, formatting is important when it comes to reading and maintaing code 
we want it to look nice, consistain
this is important when we start working on teams 
because everyone has their own way of formatting their code

So we can use something like prettier to help us
keep our code nice
