This is the notes for ProvidingCSS

there are 3 different ways to provide styles

Embedded stylesheets:
    this is including the styles in the html document 

External stylesheets:
    this allows use to write our styles in seperate files 

Inline styles:
    we can apply a style directly to a element 

##Embedded stylesheets:

in our html we are going to be working with some paragraph elements
now currently we are working with a Embedded stylesheet
but there are 2 problems with these

1. the first problem is that they are not scalable so if we have multiple pages 
it is likely that we want our styles to carry over with this approach we have to copy all of the 
styles here and place them on every single web pages
this maean if we change one thing in one file we have to do it for every file

2. the second problem is that it violates a very important principle in computer science
called seperation of concerns. 

we want to have different modules for different concerns 
html is for structuring the web page and css is to style them 
so we want to have them doing there own thing

##External stylesheets:

This helps us organize our code 
so we can take all of the rules we have and place them in a seperate file 
so we create a file called style/styles.css and place our rules there

now we need to link the html document to the External stylesheet
to so this we need to use the link element <link>

this element has 2 attributes rel (relationship) this determines 
the type of resource we are linking this document too 
next is href which we are familiar with 
here we can provide a relative or absolute url

###Clarifications:

the link element is what we call a self closing element 
it has a single tag that is self closing 

## Overriding:

now does this mean we never use embedded styles?
no sometimes we are going to want to override the styles that are defined in a 
External stylesheet

so if we wanted to change the color of this paragraph on this page only 
we use the style element and make the rule 

so we can see that embedded stylesheets overide the rules in a 
External stylesheet

## Inline styles:
this is the 3rd way to apply styles 
to a particular element 

so out of the 2 paragraphs we have on the page we are going to 
target the first one and we want to make it a different color

every html element has a style attribute and this is where we can write one or more styles 
one add more rules by seperating them with semi-colons

now inline styles are a little noisy and they violate the principle of seperation of concerns
so we should try to avoid using that 

there are better was to target a specific element 
we ca give that element a id (unique identifier)

then we can define a rule for the paragraph

## Override order:
this is the priority order from greatest to least

inline -> embedded -> external

inline will always show up above the others 

*IMPORTANT*:
The priority of external stylesheet and the embedded stylesheet is interchangeable depending 
on which one comes last

So is the external stylesheet is last the embedded stylesheet will be override
the same is true for vise versa
