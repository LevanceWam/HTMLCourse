This is the notes for Inheritance

One of the most important concepts in css that we need to 
understand is Inheritance.

this means that some css properties by default 
inherit values from there parent 

we are going to use a paragraph element and a strong element 
as a example 

now if we set the color of the paragraph element the 
strong element will inherit the color of the paragraph because it is a 
child element 

this allowed us not to write a rule for strong to make it the same color
Inheritance helps us write less code 

*Question:
    What if we wanted to stop inheritance
    what if we didn't want to inherit the value from paragraph?
    Ans:
        in the strong rule we set the value to intial and this will 
        set the color of the strong element to it's default

## Properties that do not get inherited 
so in the paragraph we are going to add a border 
now when we look at the html we see that there is a border around the 
paragraph but not the strong element 

this is because it wouldn't make make sense 
to add a border to child elements it would look weird 

But, there is a way you can inforce them 
in the strong rule we can add the border property
and give it a value of inherit 

*Just a tip:
Generally speaking the properties that deal with typography
are the ones that are inherited
so property that change the font size weight etc
