This is the notes for Tables 

we are going to make some tables 

We acomplish this by using the tables element 
we can use this to represent tabluar data

in the past we useto use this for laying out pages
this is considered bad practice because we have better ways of doing this now 

#Rows:
to define a row we use the tr element 
in this element we can have one or more cells 
which can be:
data cells 
or 
header cells

header cells are labels that describes what each column represents
all the other cells are know as data cells
because they contain data

now by default the table does not have any styles 
but we can use css to add them
so lets do this 

We are going to add a border to the table and the td (table data cell)
now we do not want to repeat the same rule 2 times
duplication in code is bad

this is why we have the DRY principle in software engineering 
DRY -> Don't Repeat Yourself

so lets fix that by adding td to the table rule 

now we have another problem there is some spacing that is causing the table to 
look ugly with the borders

so lets get rid of it 
we do this with the border collapse property

now we want to give some space between the borders and the cells 

#Header Cells:
now we are going to add a header to the cells
so we add another row and add 2 header cells

notice that the th has a different style than the td

#Improving the table:
we can make our tables more search engine friendly
and better for search readers 
we want to let them know thta we have 2 sections within
this table 

a heading and a body
We can accomplish this by using the thead and tbody elements 
we still get the same output but the markup is more meaningful 
to search engines and screen readers

this is called semantic html
semantic means meaningful

in the thead we can have multiple Rows

now optionally we can add a footer
after tbody we add tfoot

Question:
What is the difference between header and data cells in terms of styling 
Ans:
    The text is bold for the header and the text is align in the center
    where as the td is text align to the left

we can fix that with css
