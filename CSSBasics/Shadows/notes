this is the notes for Shadows

in css we can easily add shadows around elements
using box shadow property

##box-shadow property:
we have to supply a few values
1st value:
    the horizonital distance to the element 
    using a positive value will have the shadow to the right 
    negative to the left

2nd value:
    this is the vertical distance from the shadow to the element 
    positive to make it go down
    negative to go up

3rd value:
    this can be either making the shadow softer
    or color

    the softness or the blur comes before the color

now since we move the shadow to the left and down
the top and right do not have a shadow 

so if we wanted to have a very soft shadow it is a better idea it have it below the element 
so we add 0 for the first 2 values and this solves the problem

##Adding shadow to text:
we can also add show to text 
so we add a heading and change the color of the text to match the background
then we add the text-shadow property to the heading 

now there is a problem
the grey shadow is not mixing well with the blue background
its kind of all 

a cool trick to fix this is to use a semi off black using rgba
