This is the notes for containers

Quite often we need to group a bunch of elements 
for styling purposes

go here for the following examples

for example a navigation bar on a site 
it holds items, images and more 
so the navigation bar is a contianer for those elements 

another example:
a hero unit
it has a header, some text, links and a background image 

containers are used a lot in web development 
lets see how we can work with them 

in html we have a few container elements
the most commonly used one is div element (division)

this element does not have any visual appearance 
even if we give it child elements it will still show nothing 

but we can edit it in css
so the best way to edit a div in css is to give the div a class
then we are going to target the class in css
now we are going to add a background color property

now we can see that the div (contianer) is filling up the width of the page
even though it has very little content

this is happening because a div is a block-level element 

#Block-level elements:
block level elements always start on a new line and fill up the entire availiable space 
so if we duplicate our div it is going to generate on a new line 

we can use css to change their width

#Span Element:
another generic container element called span
which is often used to style text
the span element is a like a div but it is  not a block-level element div

A span element is a inline element so it is not going to take up the entire width of the page 

in html5 we have a couple more container elements that are more descriptive 
that will be covered in the next lecture
