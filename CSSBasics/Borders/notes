this is the notes for Borders

lets take a look at the border property in more detail

this property takes 3 values 
1st. for the thickness of the border
2nd. the style of the border. it can be
    - solid
    - dotted
    - dashed  
3rd value is the color

what we need to understand is that this border property
is known as a shorthand property
it takes the values and applies them to each side 

In css we have a couple of properties to define a 
border on each side 

like border-top, left, right, and bottom
another thing we need to pay attention to is the order
so if we moved border-top above border 
border is going to override bordertop so the order matters

##border-width:
with this property we can specify the width of all of the borders 
so remember this order:
    top -> right -> bottom -> left 
    this is the order of the values we are placing 

*question what happens if we get rid of the value for the left border?
    ans:
        The browser will look at the right and set the left equal to that 

same thing will happen if we remove the bottom it will look at the top 

##border-radius:
with the border radius we can make the borders round
the more we increase the pixels the rounder the edges get 

remmeber our trick if we have a square border if we set the radius to 
100% we will get a circle 

now we can make all kinds of shapes we just have to go here 
and we can get some help
