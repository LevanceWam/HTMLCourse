This is the notes for Text

We are going to take a look at the most common elements when
dealing with Text

we learned about the paragraph element
which is used to display some text

so to empithize some text we would use the em element 
it represents stress emphasis of its contents
so when ever we want to emphasis something we wrap it in the em element 

so By default browsers render em as Italics
but this does not mean that we are allowed to Italicize 
everything with the em element

remember the Purpose of this element is to emphasis content 
em Helps search engines find important content on our sites

If we want to style are paragraphs to look like italics we use CSS
so lets try to make em unitalic and red 

now back in older versions of html 
we use to use the <i> italic element 
but it is deprecated because html is not ment for styling 
only for structing content 

Another similar element is strong. Represents strong importance, seriousness,
or urgency for its contents this also helps with search engines 
the browser renders this to look bold by default
where we use this really depends on the context of our content 

another deprecated element like the strong element is the bold element
like the italic element it should not be used 


Headings:
In html we have 6 headings h1-h6

Heading 1 represents the most important heading 
heading 6 is it least important 

A common mistake that is made is that the heading are choosed based 
on their size so people just use a heading that is benefical to them 

this is not how we are suppose to use headings 
this is because the size can be changed with CSS

headings should be used to create a hierachy

every web page should have ONE AND ONLY ONE H1 ELEMENT 
this heading represents what this page is all about 
having multiple h1s can confuse search engines 

after we use h1 we should use h2 we should not skip

so lets say we wanted to break up this into sections
one for html and one for css we should use 2 different h2

now if we wanted to add sub-sections we should use h3 elements

this helps us create a hierachy
the better we can represent our structure of our document using 
html the better search engines can read and understand our content
