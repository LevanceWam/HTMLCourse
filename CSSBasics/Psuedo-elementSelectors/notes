like the first letter or the first sentence  

this is where Psuedo element selector help

##Psuedo element selectors:

so we are going to choodse the element we want to target

*Question:
    what is the difference?
    Ans:

another Psuedo element for selecting the first line of a element
it is first-line

another is the ::selection for highlighting text

another is inserting content before the content of a element
so if we wanted to insert something before a certian element on every page we can do this
this is done with ::before

::after is similar but is added at the end
