This is the notes for CSS Basics

In the head element we are going to add another element called 
style. (We are going to use a external css)

this is where we would write our css rules 
we are going to work on the image 

so in the styles.css we are going to reference the 
image element by typing img{}

inside of the braces we write one or more css declarations 
each declaration contians a property and a value 

so we are going to change the width of the image
the image is now smaller

Lets try to make the edges of the image round
we can accomplish this by using the border-radius property
this will help the image look smooth

*Cool Tip*:
If we set the border-radius to half of the width we are going to
get a circle

Now the everything is set vertically
lets say we want the image to the left of the text
we can do this by using float 

now we want to add some space between the image and the text
so we can use margin here to help us out 


now lets make the text bold
we can use the font-weight property
now both of the paragraph text is bold

but what if we wanted to apply this style only to the username?
we would have to seperate the 2 paragraph elements
this is where we can give the element a attribute called class

class is short for classifaction and we can use this attribute
to put this element inside a different class or different catergory

now with the old rule we had we were targeting all of the 
paragraph elements on the page 
now we are going to change it so that only paragraph elements witht the 
class username is affected

so we get rid of the p and add .username
this will effect all of the elements that have this class
whether they are paragraphs or not

using this declaration p.username
only effects paragraphs with this class

notice that css has a different syntax(grammar) than html
