This is the notes for NormalizingCSS

as we already know we have a good bit of browsers out 
and unforunately some browsers render html elements differently

to address this issue we use a popular stylesheet called 
Normalize.css this stylesheet it provides basic default styles for some html elements 
so they look exactly the same way across different browsers
with this we don't have to waste time dealing with rendering issues across different process

following this link: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
we can download the latest version
(we can aslo install this using npm install normalize.css)

once we have it downloaded we are going to move it into a 
css folder along with styles.css

##Inside of normalize.css:
Here are some of the things that are going on with in the file 

we have a html rule that sets the line height of the html element
because different browsers have different values for this property

it also sets the margin of the body to 0 and there is no longer going to be space around the content of the body element

but we will add it back in our css file 

form here on out we are going to be using 
normalize.css
