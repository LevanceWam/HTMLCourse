This is the notes for Semantic elements

In the last lecture we went over that 
divs and spans are generic containers 

but HTML5 introduced a couple of elements that are more descriptive or more 
meaningful. they are called

#Semantic Elements:
article
figure
mark
time

so where ever possible we should use these new Elements
instead of the generic containers because this helps search engines better understand our pages 
and what they contain. 

#article element:
so lets say we wanted to represent a blog post
so the generic way would be to use a div with the class of article
with some text

now there is nothing wrong with this approach but we can make this better 
more meaningful by using  semantic elements 

in html5 we have a element called article that is used to represent articles or post
we can use this element to make the markup more meaningful to search engines 

now the article does not need to be a blog post or newspaper article
it can be:
"An independent, self-contained content"
Examples:
forum post
comments
reviews
product cards

on adobe.com we can see 3 different representation of product cards
each of them code be a article element 

an article can contain one or more figures, img,
tables, list and so on.
so we can add a img in the article 
but to make it more meaningful we can wrap it inside of a figure 

#figure:
the figure element is just a contianer for figuares
it does not have any visual characteristics

figures can optionally have a caption
it can be above or below the figure 
this is done with the figcaption

#mark element:
Now sometimes we want to highlight our text
so in the last lecture we used the span element 
but in html5 we have a new element called mark element
this does the samething as our highlight class from the last lecture 

#time element:
Now most articles have a published date and time 
so below the heading we can do this 

now optionally we can pass the datetime attribute 
we have to follow the format
