This is the notes for BasicSelectors

##Selectors
In css we have a few different ways to select elements for
styling purposes. 
We can select them by their:
- Type
- ID
- class
- attribute

So we have seen this in action but we are going to go over it again
and get the terminology correct

##terminology:

- Selector:
    A selector is an element we choose to select in css
    it is called a selector because we are selecting a element to apply rules to 
    in styles.css body is a selector and we are selecting it by its type the body element 

    We can also use id's as a selector
    the same can be done with classes

    *Question:
        What is the difference between the id and class attributes?
        Ans: you can not have the same id for multiple elements
        you can only have one element for one id. But you can have one 
        class for multiple elements. id's have to be unqiue

    A metaphor to help us rememeber.
    In the real world we can not have 2 people with the same passport #

    Moving on we can also select elements by their attributes event though this is not 
    common but there is a chance we will see it in someone else's code

    so lets say we want to target all of the <a> with a target attribute
