This is the notes for structuring a web page

we are going to look at the semantic elements for structuring web pages
most web pages have at least 3 building blocks:
- header
- main content
- footer
all of these are html elements
this is a pretty common structure

#aside element
sometimes we can have a sidebar for advertising 
content not directly related to the main content
this is the aside element

#header:
often we have a navigation bar with a list 
of links 

#footer:
the same can be done for the footer
so we can have multiple navigation elements on the same page 

#main element:
    #section element:
sometimes in the main area we have multiple sections 
with the section element we can group related content
now every section should have a heading which is often a h2 
but it depends where we are in the heading heirarchy

so if we don't supply a heading we can get a validation error for this section
then inside of the section we can use a article to represent independent content

now we need to clarify something!
this is not the only way to structure a web page this is an example 

#Recap:
<main>: used to represent the main content of the page.
every page can only have one main element 
* if we use more than 1 main we get a validation error

<section>: used to group related content.

<header>: used to represent introductory content
which can belong to the page or a section or article

<footer>: can be used in the same way as the header

<aside>: used to represent content not directly related to the main content
