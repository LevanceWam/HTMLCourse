This is the notes for Images 

We are gonna talk about embedded images 
so we are going to use a image from unsplash.com

https://unsplash.com/

we are going to download a small image
we are going to want to rename the image because this helps out with 
SEO this this is a small SEO tip search engines can better understand and index our pages 

Now we use alt text attribute to add description to our image 
this is highly recommended to do because it helps makes our page accessible to
to visually impaired people they use screen readers to read the website to them 
so alt tell them what is on the page 

Please do not write something like image 1 or anything non descriptive

using the alt text attribute also helps with SEO

and if the image cant be loaded then the alt is shown

Resizing images:
we can use css to resize our images 
so we are going to set the height and the width for this image 

now there is a tiny problem the image looks squashed
this is because we are dealing with a rectanglaur image 
but we are converting it to a square image so it is vertically squashed

so if we disable the height property (in dev tools)
we can see that it is no longer squished

to solve this problem we have a new property called object-fit
most of the time we use the value cover 
so the image covers its contianing box

Conceptually there is a containing box around every element 
in html document, we can not see this box but the browser uses this box to figure out 
how the page should be displayed 

so for the img element the we set the width and the height of the box 
and in this box we are trying to insert our image 
so when we set the value to cover it is going to resize the image and potentially cropped 
so it covers the entire containing box

so in the dev tools we can play with all of the values and see which one works the best for us
