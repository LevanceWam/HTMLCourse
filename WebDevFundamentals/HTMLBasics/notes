This is the notes for HTML Basics

First we are going to create a index.html 
next we are going to tell the browser that this is a html 5 document 

we do this by typing <!DOCTYPE html>
this is known as doctype declaration

in previous versions the doctype declaration was really long
but html5 solves this 

also html is not a case sensitive language 
but by convention we type everything in lower case expect DOCTYPE
but this is just a convention

Now under the <!DOCTYPE html>
we use our html elements to define the structure of the page

first tag we are going to use is the <html></html>
this tag has a closing tag like most of the elements do 
but some of the elements do not have a closing tag

next up are the body and head tags

the head tag is used to give information about the page 
for example the title tag

next up in the body tag we add elements that are going to show up on
the page 

we are going to use the image element <img>
this element doesn't have a closing tag
this means that this element can not have any child elements
in older versions of html we use to have to write it like this 
<img/>
this meant that this was a self closing tag
html5 doesn't require this 

in the img we have 2 attributes src and alt
with these attributes we can supply addition information about an element 
the src attribute is used to specify the path to a image 

alt is short for alternative text 
used to show subtext if the image can not be displayed in the browser
