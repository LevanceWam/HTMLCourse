This is the notes for Hyperlinks

To create links to other pages and sites we use the
achor element <a>

every achor element needs a href: (hypertext reference)
we are going to make a url to a page called about in this folder 

so in the href we can link to a relative or absolute url

A relative url starts from the current page 
so since index.html and about.html are in the same 
folder we can just right the name of the file

now if the file was in a different folder 
this still counts as a relative url 

we can also use relative urls for our img src 

in short:
relative urls start from the current page 
and then it goes somewhere else 

absolute urls:
There are times we are going to be working in heavily nested 
folders and to keep going a level up for our hyperlinks can be a little messy

This is where we can use absolute urls 
so we start with a "/" this represents the root of the site 

back in html 
we can link to non-html documents like images, pdf, and powerpoints 
so we are going to link a image
now we can prompt the user to download the image by 
adding the download attribute
now when we click the link the image will download instead of being on the screen

We can also link to different parts of the page 
so we are going to link to the css section on this site 

we can give the h2 for css a unqiue identifer so we can give it make it a link
so we are going to set the id attribute to css 
this is what we call a fragment or a place on the page 
now we are going to add a link to the fragment 

to jump back to the top of the page in the href attribute add #
what is the difference between hyperlink and link

link is just the address the url the location of the target page 
hyperlink is the element the user can click on to navigate to the target page
