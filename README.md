> Essential Skills to know.

Every website has two parts the Front-end and the Back-end. The front-end is the part of the site that we interact with. All of the visual aspects.

The Back-end powers the front-end it is behind the scences and is mainly about
storing data in databases and providing it to the front-end.

For this tutorial we are going to focus on the front-end aspect.

Front-end Developers use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build front-ends.

_HTML_: Hypertext Markup Language.
This is the building blocks for our web pages.

_CSS_: Cascading Stylesheet.
Used for styling the webpages and making them look awesome.

_Javascript_: Is used for adding functionality to the webpages. Javascript is a programming language, this allows us to add functionality to sites.

CSS and HTML are not programming language instead they are the building blocks for making pages and styling them.

## Frameworks

Building websites often include a lot of repetitive task. This is where front-end frameworks and libraries come in. A framework or a library comes with a lot of code that we can reuse in our website, they help us get the job done faster.

Some of these frameworks/libraries are:

- React (library)
- Angular
- Vue

Just a heads up we do not need to learn all of these. Different companies use different frameworks for different projects. React is the most popular tool.

## Version control systems

We use version control systems to track our project historty and to work collaboratively with others. There are plenty of systems out there such as:

- Git
- SubVersion (SVN)
- Mercurial
- and more!
