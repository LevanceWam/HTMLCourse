> An overview of HTML basics

In this section we are going to go over all of the essential HTML elements to build web pages.

## Head Section

In the head section we have a couple of meta elements for giving information about this web page. The purpose of meta elements with these elements
we can give information about a webpage

```html
<head>
  <!-- this defines the character set used in the document -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />

  <!-- this meta element configures the viewport of the page -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

  <!-- this meta element is used to define keywords on the page -->
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS" />

  <!-- this meta element provides the description for the website on search engines -->
  <meta name="description" content="This is the description for this website" />
</head>
```
