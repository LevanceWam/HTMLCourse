this is th notes for Video and Audio

In html we have great support for embedding video and Audio
for example on sketch.com this is a wonderful
example of this but it does not have video controls

so we are going to learn how to embed video and audio to our web pages
so we are going to go to:
https://www.pexels.com/
This is a great place to use free photos and videos

we are going to download the HD file because it is smaller
we don't want to embed a large file because this can give the user a 
bad experience watching the video

to embed the video we are going to use the video element 
just like a img we can use a relative or absolute url

now by default we get a image of the video and the image is shown at the 
full size this gives us a horizotal scroll which is bad
so we are going to use css to change the width of the video
We do not need to set the height because the browser will use the aspect ratio
to do it for us 

now we are going to add the control buttons 
to do this all we need to do is add the controls attribute

the controls attribute is what we call a boolean attribute
some people believe we can set this attributes to true or false but this is not correct 
if we set controls to false it is still going to show in the browser

This is how they work:
The presence of a boolean attribute represents true the absences of the attribute
represents false

we have another boolean attribute called autoplay
this automatically starts the video

another one is loop
this will automatically loop the video

now browsers these days have exellent support for the video element 
but there is one browser that does not support it 

so if we go to https://caniuse.com/
we can see how different browsers support different html elements
and css features

so for the browsers that do not support videos we give 
them a fall back text

We have another element for audio and it is exactly the same as audio
