This is the notes for Inspecting pages using Devtools

Remember that the DOM (Document Object Model)
is given to us when the browser reads the html document 
that is returned from the server the DOM is constructed

if we use the developer tools in chrome
and navigate to the element tab we can see the DOM

here we can click on the elements we want to inspect and on the left side 
we can see the styles applied to the element 

we can enable or disable properties 
change values 
and more 

A lot of Front-end devs use devtools to play 
the styles and get the look that they want 
once the exact styles and values are in they apply them in the constructed
