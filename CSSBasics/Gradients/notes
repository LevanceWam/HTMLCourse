this is the notes for Gradients

now that we know about colors we are going to move to gradients 
with gradients we can create beautiful transitions between one or 
more colors 

Gradients are technically images 
to set a gradient we cann not use the background-color property
we need to use the background-image property or the shorthand
background property

##background property:
we can set this to either a image or color
to make a gradient we pass the liner-gradient function
and pass 2 colors 

###linear-gradient
now by default the direction of the transition is from top to bottom 
but we can change this.
for the first agrument we can provide a direction
we can go to the right or left 
and we can target corners by adding top or bottom

we can also target the direction by degrees
We can also determine the amount of space a color takes on the gradient by adding a percentage next to the color
this is all for linear-gradients

in CSS we have another kind of gradient called 
radical-gradient
now we can supply 2 colors like earlier 
and the gradient starts in the middle and comes out like a circle 

now we have this circle shape because the div is a square 
but if we change the width we get a Eclipse
but we can pass the word circle as a agrument to get a circle again 
and we can change the position of it 

this is how we create gradients 

Now there are tools online that can help us 
create these gradients and we can copy the css
